        <p>We care if you have a personal relationship with God. We care if you grow in grace and knowledge
                of our Lord and Savior-Jesus the Christ. We care that your love for the savior is developed where
                you share the joy of knowing Jesus with others.
            </p>
       <div>We are a great place for you to:</div>
       <ul>
            <li>Love God</li>
            <li>Love People</li>
            <li>Make a Difference</li>
       </ul>
       <p>So, if you're just getting started in Christ...or if you are starting 
           over...consider Christian Fellowship as your place to encounter, grown, and love.
